# Persona 3 Reload: React One-Page Front-End

This project is a React-based one-page front-end inspired by **Persona 3 Reload**, a game that I am particularly fond of. The project is designed to be visually appealing and can be expanded upon with additional features and updates in the future.

## Version 1.0

### Features
- **Hardcoded Questions**: This version includes 10 hardcoded questions. Future versions could easily be updated to pull questions from an API or other dynamic sources.

## How to Run This Project on Your Machine

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Navigate to the project directory (`react-reloaded`) and install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd react-reloaded
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**  
   While still in the `react-reloaded` directory, start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **View the Project**  
   The website should automatically open in your default browser. If it doesn't, you can manually open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
